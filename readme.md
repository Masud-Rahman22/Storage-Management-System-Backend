To update all the packages in your `package.json` to their latest versions, you can use the following steps:

1. **Update Dependencies:**

   Install `npm-check-updates` globally if you donâ€™t have it already:

   ```bash
   npm install -g npm-check-updates
   ```

   Then, check for updates and update your `package.json`:

   ```bash
   ncu -u
   ```

   This command updates the `package.json` file with the latest versions of your dependencies.

2. **Install the Updated Packages:**

   After updating `package.json`, install the latest versions:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Package Versions:**

   If you want to see which packages have been updated and verify their versions, you can use:

   ```bash
   npm outdated
   ```

   This command lists the outdated packages with their current, wanted, and latest versions.

4. **Update DevDependencies:**

   Similarly, you can update devDependencies by running the same `ncu -u` command and then `npm install`.

Following these steps will update all packages to their latest versions and adjust your `package.json` accordingly.
